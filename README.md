1) Download the app from github.
2) Install dependencies\
use `npm i`
3) Start development server (local environment) \

## Tech stack
- **React**: for UI manipulation.
- **Redux**: for state managment.
- **MaterialUI v5**: for UI style, components, icons and theme.

## Side notes
I tried to make the app as close to a real use case\
which includes sorting by priorities, showing the date of the creation of a task\
in a real sincario I would have added more features like:
- Adding due time
- Sharing tasks between pepole
- More tasks types
